# Invisible-Cloak
This project creates an “invisibility cloak” effect using computer vision. By detecting a specific color range in the video frame (for example, red), it replaces that region with the background captured earlier — making the selected color appear invisible in real-time.

# 🪄 Invisible Cloak using OpenCV

Bring a bit of Hogwarts magic to life with Python and OpenCV!  
This project creates an *“invisibility cloak”* effect in real-time video — just like the one Harry Potter uses.  

When a specific color (like red or blue) is detected in front of the camera, that region is replaced with the background, making it appear invisible.
